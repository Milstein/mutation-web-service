Round 3

Same as Round 2, but now some items are priced by weight.

The data contained in the price list will identify which items are priced by weight(kg).
Quantities of items sold by weight may not be integers (1.234 = 1kg and 234g)

You PUT the result to /Checkout/Batch/your_team_name

The JSON payload should look something like this:
    {"batch":{"baskets":{"1":{"dollars":0,"cents":75},"2":{"dollars":7,"cents":25}}}}
     basket ID from batch ^                            ^
          total cost of each basket     ^          ^                 ^          ^
            (which you have calculated)
