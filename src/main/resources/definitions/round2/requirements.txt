Round 2

Same as Round 1, but this time you need to use a price list to work out what items cost

GET the URL /Checkout/PriceList/your_team_name to retrieve your price list

You PUT the result to /Checkout/Batch/your_team_name

The JSON payload should look something like this:
    {"batch":{"baskets":{"1":{"dollars":0,"cents":75},"2":{"dollars":7,"cents":25}}}}
     basket ID from batch ^                            ^
          total cost of each basket     ^          ^                 ^          ^
            (which you have calculated)
